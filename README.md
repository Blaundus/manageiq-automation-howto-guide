# Introduction to CloudForms Automation

## What?
This book is an introduction to working with the CloudForms Automation Engine.

The book is a work-in progress, so the format and content is liable to change as the work progresses. Please feel free however to peruse the developing pages, find errors, and suggest changes or additional topics.

## Why Write This?
The Automation functionality of CloudForms / ManageIQ seems to be one of the challenging aspects of the product to master. It is (mostly) documented in the official manuals, but wading through these documents can be challenging in itself.

This book is an attempt to document my learning experiences with CloudForms Automation, and hopefully ease the process for others to master this incredibly powerful aspect of the product.

## Assumptions
This book does not seek to teach Ruby, I am assuming a reasonable level of competence with the language. There are many on-line Ruby tutorials available, including Codecademy's [Learn to program in Ruby]( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) which looks quite good (disclaimer: I haven't personally worked through this tutorial, but have seen it recommended).
