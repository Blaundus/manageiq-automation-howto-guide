## Classes, Schemas and Instances

A **class** contains a generic definition for a set of automation operations. Each class has a **schema**, that defines the variables, states, relationships or methods that **instances** of the class will use. A schema often has just one entry - to run a single method.

An **instance** is a specific "clone" of the generic class, with actual values of the schema attributes filled in.
